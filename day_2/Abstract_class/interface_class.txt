- can not able to create objects for this class
- instead of class abstract class_name keyword - > interface class_name/interface_name
- body of methods of interface must be implemented in subclass
- interface variables are always (implicit)
	public - to available all over other classes.
	static - to access directly by its interfacename.
	final - to avoid access conflict in subclass.  
- interface methods are pulbic and absract (implicit)
- non abstract methods/fully constructed methods inside the interface behaves as same the super class method behaviours(after java8)
- can able to implement multiple interface with sperated by ' , '
