OverLoading:
- Compile time polymorphism
- Declaring methods with same name but different signatures(method signatures=method name and parameter list)
- A class doent not have 2 methods with same signatures
- static as well as non-static methods


Overriding:
- Run time polymorphism
- Same name and signatures,same or different return type
- achieved through inheritence
- Dynamic method dispatch mechanism ->the correct version of an overridden method is called at runtime.
