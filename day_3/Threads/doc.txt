Thread &  Process, for multitasking.

Synchronization(for both process and thread)

Synchronization in MultiThreading: to prevent thread interference

	-Synchronized method (different instance for different object)
	-Synchronized block
	-static Synchronized (one instance for entire program)
    -- Synchronization access flow of thread in java(not for static):
    acquire object's lock -> continuously accessing object's fields -> lock release
